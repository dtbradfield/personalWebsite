# personalWebsite
This is my code for the personal website I have personally crafted to learn full-stack web development. All code is typed, never copy-pasted, and original.
This project currently uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
This README will be updated as I add in more features and languages/libraries/frameworks.
