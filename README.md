# personalWebsite
This is my code for the personal website I have personally crafted to learn full-stack web development. All code is typed, never copy-pasted, and original. This project currently uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This README will be updated as I add in more features and languages/libraries/frameworks.

The first project I am assigning myself is to create a clock page for my website, and creating a countdown timer that may be used on the same page.
